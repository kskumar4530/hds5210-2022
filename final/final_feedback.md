# Feedback on Final

From the start, I like your documentation and the clear notes about the objective and what I should be looking for in the notebook. Overall, I think you did a great job.

One of the requirements for the final project (and a best practice) is to organize your code into functions that can be tested and reused. Your project didn't make any use of functions and didn't provide any validation or testing for transformation logic you used.  (-10 from Modularity and Style)

Your conclusions and writeup at the end were well done. Nice work!!
